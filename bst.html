    <h1>Sample App</h1>
    <p>In the Unified Modeling Language (UML), a use case diagram is used
        to summarize the details of your system's users (also known as actors)
        and their interactions with the system.Suppose you are working in a software engineering team assigned the task
        of developing system for a bank. The system will be used for transactions
        handling, staff communication, management reporting and e-banking.
        Bank officers will be using the system for transactions handing and
        communication. The bank manager will be using the system to view
        management reports and communication. Bank customers will enjoy e-
        banking when the system is deployed.</p>
